# Second Deliverable

For the second deliverable various mechanism and strategies are required to
optimize the best algorithm taken from the first deliverable to achieve
**Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication** using the **Compressed Sparse Row**
matrix format.

The main goal is to use multiple strategies to optimize the previous best GPU
implementation which can be run inside the university cluster and a report
discussing the obtained results.

## Project Structure

The project is subdivided into **two different folders**, one for the
implementations, written mostly in *C* and the *CUDA* programming languages, and
the other containing the *LaTeX* report based on the *IEEE* template.

> To compile the report, installation and linking of mutliple *LaTeX* libraries
> may be required.
