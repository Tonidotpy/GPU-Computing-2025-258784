# First Deliverable

The first deliverable requires the implementation of different algorithms to
achieve the **Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication** using the **Compressed
Sparse Row** matrix format.

The main goal is to have multiple working implementations both on CPU and GPU
which can be run inside the university cluster and a report discussing the
obtained results.

## Project Structure

The project is subdivided into **two different folders**, one for the
implementations, written mostly in *C* and the *CUDA* programming languages, and
the other containing the *LaTeX* report based on the *IEEE* template.

To compile the report, installation and linking of mutliple *LaTeX* libraries
may be required.
